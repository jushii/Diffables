# Diffables

ðŸš§ **Work in progress, experimental library developed for learning purposes** ðŸš§

**Diffables** is a .NET library for state synchronization and delta-based serialization, directly inspired by [Colyseus Schema](https://github.com/colyseus/schema). It relies on incremental source generators and C# 13's partial properties to automatically monitor changes in your data models and serialize only whatâ€™s been modified.
